# PUNK'D!

This is just a joke script to give to people when I don't know what to do about their issue. Feel free to add "functions" to this by modifying the list at the top of the script. Also feel free to convert this to other languages for maximum hilarity.

To run this in python3, use curl:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwre/fixt/master/reprd.py | python3`

or wget:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwre/fixt/master/reprd.py | python3`
